        <p>PV - Peak to Valley - the difference in height from the highest peak to the lowest valley. 
          Generally measured in fraction of waves. See waves below.</p>
          <p>wave (general)- Generally defined to be green at 550 nm, but often a HeNe (Helium Neon) 
            laser is used for this test and is at 632.8 nm.</p>
          <p>f/# - The focal ratio, or "f number" as it is commonly called, is the ratio of the focal 
            length to the diameter of the mirror. For example, a telescope with an aperture (diameter) 
            of 10 inches and a focal length of 80 inches, would have an f/# of 8, and be called an f/8 
            10-inch.</p>
          <p>sagitta - By definition it is the depth of a circular arc, and in our case is the depth of the center of the mirror. It is often measured by placing a 
                    straight edge along the mirror and sticking something with a known distance in between that straight edge and the center of the mirror. For
                    my sagitta needs I used a feeler gauge purchased from harbor freight..</p>
