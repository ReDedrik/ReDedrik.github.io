        <p>M name is Jared Eshleman, and I am a graduate from Texas A&M University living in Wisconsin. In my undergraduate time at TAMU I came to enjoy programming, astronomy, and engineering. Telescopes are a fun and rewarding way to practice these skills. </p>
        <p>My goal with this website is to document my projects and adventures, and to share my knowledge with others. If you find anything useful, see something you have a question about, want to chat, or just tell me I'm wrong feel free to email me at redmanesh@gmail.com or text at 703-328-7283.</p>
