    <h1>Eos</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p class="left-align">Eos is a 6in f/10 truss dobsonian telescope. It is my 
        first telescope of my own design, and currently still a work in progress.</p>
    <h2>Mirror Grinding</h2>
    <p class="left-align">Grinding your own mirror is one way to guarantee any 
        optical defects are your fault and not the manufacturer's. Aside from 
        large cracks or bubbles in the glass, you can grind and polish your mirror 
        to an unparalleled (without some serious money) surface. It is well within 
        the limits of a personally finished mirror to be within a PV of 1/20 wave. 
        It is certainly possible to get better, but beyond that the human eye can't 
        tell much of a difference. Sophisticated equipment can test to a much higher 
        degree, 1/50 or higher. 1/10 is generally considered "good" or "high quality 
        optics", and 1/4 is generally the absolute minimum (or maybe maximum?) you 
        want for your mirror as that is a diffraction limited mirror, per the Rayleigh 
        criterion. </p>
    <p class="left-align">I sourced my mirror blanks in April of 2024 from a man in 
        Austin who had originally bought them with the intention of making his own 
        telescope. Life got busy and he didn't get around to it, so I purchased 
        them from his ad on astromart. He gave me a 6-inch pyrex blank from 
        firsthanddiscovery.com, as well as the 6-inch kit he had purchased for it. 
        I also bought from him an 8-inch blank. </p>
    <p class="left-align">Starting is often the hardest part. It is difficult as a 
        broke college student to muster the courage to deface and grind away on 
        something you spent a considerable amount of money on. The risk of ruining 
        the mirror was a horror that kept me away for far too long. The mirror blanks 
        sat untouched in my closet for almost a year before I started working on them 
        in February of 2025. Many people recommend working on a round, belly high table. 
        Some recommend even old barrels or turntables. My roommate at the time had made 
        a woodworking bench over a year prior, and had since moved on to bigger and 
        better benches (aka power tools). He gave it to me to do my mirror grinding, 
        but still I waited. He threatened to burn it if I didn't use it, and thus 
        began my mirror journey. </p>

    <p class="left-align">I began by making a tile tool. I used the tried and true method 
        documented by Stellafane, and certainly won't bore with that here. I used Bob Smith 
        epoxy (a little too much) and it was a bit tacky in some spots. It could have been 
        from the temperature, as it is recommended to cure at 70 fahrenheit or above, and 
        it was a cool 68. However I believe it was a mixture of too much epoxy and poor 
        mixing of the epoxy. After making my tool I finally began rough grinding. I 
        exclusively used mirror on top (MOT) for this, and only used silicon carbide #80. 
        Because my focal ratio was so high I had to grind very little, and all in all I only 
        ended up working for about 90 minutes before I had even surpassed my sagitta!</p>

    <p class="left-align">Before I began fine grinding I took on the arduous but 
    necessary task of cleaning the #80 grit off of my tool, mirror, and workspace. 
    However when I was cleaning I noticed the grit had completely adhered to the tacky 
    epoxy of my first tool. Unfortunately this meant I could absolutely not use this tool 
    for fine grinding. I made a second tool and much more thoroughly mixed the epoxy this 
    time, as well as a much thinner coat. It is miles better, and goes to show the only 
    way to learn is to do.</p>
    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p class="left-align">Before I started fine grinding I decided to at least have a 
        fairly good idea of what I wanted the telescope to look like. I began by looking 
        for something to be the tube of the telescope. Originally I had planned to use 
        concrete form tubes (sonotubes), however these come in standard sizes that did not 
        suit my focal length of 60". Eventually I decided that I would use a truss design, 
        as it complements the visual, weight, and collapsible needs I had envisioned. 
        I travel very frequently by car and need to be able to pack it efficiently. After 
        that, I began the most stressful part of the design: the primary mirror cell. </p>

    <p class="left-align">The mirror cell gave me many headaches. I have spent many hours 
        staring into the soul of this solidworks creation (my third one ever) to make it 
        suit my needs and hopefully not mess up too many times. I finally settled 
        on a design that took some inspiration from a mirror cell @hillexed had done for 
        his Leavitt telescope. Similar to their's I decided to have seperately printed vertical 
        support, and as someone cleverly mentioned in the atm discord, I used the xy-precision 
        of a 3d printer to only hold on to the bevel of my mirror.</p>
