    <h1>Science</h1>
    <p>While you can read a thousand articles about the science behind optics and the engineering behind a mirror cell, I am firm in my belief that teaching (or in this case writing)
      is the best way to learn and cement your understanding of a topic. </p>
      <h2>Randomness</h2>
      <p>By far the most interesting part about generating a mirror is the way the curve is generated.
        It is amazing that through random motion one can create a mirror far superior to what most 
        machines can create. While true randomness is hard to come by, the psuedorandomness of our mirror grinding is good enough. 
        To go over why this works, one has to know the general process of grinding a curve.</p>
        <p>The general process for grinding or "hogging" a curve is using the "chordal" stroke. It is named as such because the focus of the stroke is
          making the mirror (which is on top) follow a "chord" of the tool (on bottom). With about 40% of the mirror hanging off the side, 
          you follow a chord on the tool away and towards you, while putting pressure on the mirror. Every 5-10 strokes (full back and forth) 
          you turn the mirror a bit (anywhere from 20-80 degrees). Every 1-6 of turning the mirror, you turn the tool in the <u>opposite</u>
          direction. This may seem a strange process to some. The center of the mirror is always in contact with the edge of the tool and being ground. 
          Just next to the center of the mirror is being ground not always, but almost all of the time. Slightly farther out is 
          being ground slightly less. Once we get to the edge of the mirror, which is only in contact with the tool a fraction of the time
          that the center is. Over thousands and thousands of these strokes, the random motion generates an incredibly accurate spherical curve.
        </p>
        <p>Now because we are using randomness to generate our curve, we must ensure that any process we perform is not dictated by
          habit or procedure. The only rule is to not make more rules. We want everything to be random, to the amount hanging off
          of the tool, the number of strokes before we turn the mirror, strokes before we turn tool, the pressure we apply to the mirror,
          and any other factor that can be introduced.
