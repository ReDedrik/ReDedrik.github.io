    <h2>Mirror Grinding</h2>
    <p class="left-align">Grinding your own mirror is one way to gaurantee any optical defects are your fault and not the manufacturer's. Aside from large cracks or bubbles in the glass, you can grind and polish your mirror to an unparalleled (without some serious money) surface. It is well within the limits of a personally finished mirror to be within a PV of 1/20 wave. It is certainly possible to get better, but beyond that the human eye can't tell much of a difference. Sophisticated equipment can test to a much higher degree, 1/50 or higher. 1/10 is generally considered "good" or "high quality optics", and 1/4 is generally the absolute minimum (or maybe maximum?) you want for your mirror as that is a diffraction limited mirror, per the Rayleigh criterion.<br>

        I sourced my mirror blanks in April of 2024 from a man in Austin who had originally bought them with the intention of making his own telescope. Life got busy and he didn't get around to it, so I purchased them from his ad on astromart. He gave me a 6-inch pyrex blank from firsthanddiscovery.com, as well as the 6-inch kit he had purchased for it. I also bought from him an 8-inch blank.

        Starting is often the hardest part. It is difficult as a broke college student to muster the courage to deface and grind away on something you spent a considerable amount of money on. The risk of ruining the mirror was a horror that kept me away for far too long. The mirror blanks sat untouched in my closet for almost a year before I started working on them in February of 2025. Many people recommend working on a round, belly high table. Some recommend even old barrels or turntables. My roommate at the time had made a woodworking bench over a year prior, and had since moved on to bigger and better benches (aka power tools). He gave it to me to do my mirror grinding, but still I waited. He threatened to burn it if I didn't use it, and thus began my mirror journey.
        <br><br>

I began by making a tile tool. I used the tried and true method documented by Stellafane, and certainly won't bore with that here. I used Bob Smith epoxy (a little too much) and it was a bit tacky in some spots. It could have been from the temperature, as it is recommended to cure at 70 fahrenheit or above, and it was a cool 68. However I believe it was a mixture of too much epoxy and poor mixing of the epoxy. After making my tool I finally began rough grinding. I exclusively used mirror on top (MOT) for this, and only used silicon carbide #80. Because my focal ratio was so high I had to grind very little, and all in all I only ended up working for about 90 minutes before I had even surpassed my sagitta!</p>
